add('A network administrator has just changed the router ID on a router that is working in an OSPFv2 environment. What should the administrator do to reset the adjacencies and use the new router ID?',
    'Issue the clear ip ospf process privileged mode command.');
add('What three conclusions can be drawn from the displayed output? (Choose three.)',
    'The DR can be reached through the GigabitEthernet 0/0 interface.',
    'The router ID values were not the criteria used to select the DR and the BDR.',
    'There have been 9 seconds since the last hello packet sent.');
add('Which conclusion can be drawn from this OSPF multiaccess network?',
    'With an election of the DR, the number of adjacencies is reduced from 6 to 3.');
add('Which OSPF feature allows a remote OSPF area to participate in OSPF routing when it cannot connect directly to OSPF Area 0?',
    'virtual link');
add('What are three resulting DR and BDR elections for the given topology? (Choose three.)',
    'R1 is DR for segment A.',
    'R2 is BDR for segment A.',
    'R5 is BDR for segment B.');
add('When checking a routing table, a network technician notices the following entry:',

    'show ip ospf interface serial 0/0/0');
add('A network engineer suspects that OSPFv3 routers are not forming neighbor adjacencies because there are interface timer mismatches. Which two commands can be issued on the interface of each OSFPv3 router to resolve all timer mismatches? (Choose two.)',
    'no ipv6 ospf hello-interval',
    'no ipv6 ospf dead-interval');
add('A network engineer has manually configured the hello interval to 15 seconds on an interface of a router that is running OSPFv2. By default, how will the dead interval on the interface be affected?',

    'There is a mismatch of OSPF process ID in commands.');
add('An administrator is troubleshooting OSPFv3 adjacency issues. Which command would the administrator use to confirm that OSPFv3 hello and dead intervals are matching between routers?',
    'show ipv6 ospf interface');
add('What three states are transient OPSF neighbor states that indicate a stable adjacency is not yet formed between two routers? (Choose three.)',

add('Which routers are the DR and BDR in this topology?',
    'DR:R3 BDR:R5');
add('A network administrator is configuring multiarea OSPFv3 on the routers. The routing design requires that the router RT1 is a DROTHER for the network in Area 0 and the DR for the network in Area 1. Check the settings and status of the routers. What can the administrator do to ensure that RT1 will meet the design requirement after all routers restart?',
    'Use the ipv6 ospf priority 10 command on the interface g0/2 of RT1.');
